    <h3>Application Overview</h3>
    <p>Syllabye is an application created to serve professors and other university administrators in the process of creating and updating syllabi.
        Syllabi tend to change every semester with new requirements such as updated classroom content, health and safety guidelines, links to campus resources, schedule changes, and many more features. 
        The end goal of the software for the user is to help them make this process less time-consuming so that educators can spend more time devoted to teaching and helping students.
